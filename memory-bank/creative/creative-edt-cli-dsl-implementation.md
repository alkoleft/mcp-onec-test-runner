# Creative Design: EDT CLI DSL Implementation and Utility Discovery Integration

## üéØ Design Overview

The EDT CLI DSL implementation provides immediate execution capabilities for 1C:EDT CLI commands with a clean, fluent API that integrates seamlessly with the existing platform infrastructure. This design focuses on **execute-on-call** semantics, where commands are run immediately and return results, contrasting with the plan-based approach used by ibcmd.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Analysis

### Current State Assessment
‚úÖ **Already Implemented:**
- `EDT_CLI("1cedtcli")` utility type in `PlatformDomain.kt`
- EDT base path `/opt/1C/1CE/components` in `LinuxSearchStrategy`
- Complete `EdtDsl` implementation with `EdtContext` and `EdtResult`
- Integration via `PlatformDsl.edt(version) { ... }`
- Process execution infrastructure via `ProcessExecutor`

### Architecture Patterns Identified
1. **Immediate Execution Pattern**: Commands execute synchronously and return results
2. **Context-Based Utility Resolution**: Uses `PlatformUtilityContext` for utility discovery
3. **Result Wrapping**: Consistent `EdtResult` structure with success, output, error, exitCode, and duration
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with graceful fallbacks

## üé® Design Decisions

### 1. Execute-on-Call vs Plan-Based Approach
**Decision**: Execute-on-Call for EDT CLI
**Rationale**: 
- EDT CLI commands are typically short-lived and don't require complex orchestration
- Immediate feedback is more valuable for development workflows
- Simpler mental model for developers

### 2. Command Surface Design
**Minimal Command Set**:
- `version()` - Get EDT version information
- `help()` - Show available commands and options  
- `run(vararg args: String)` - Execute arbitrary EDT CLI commands

**Rationale**:
- Covers 80% of common use cases
- Provides escape hatch for advanced scenarios
- Maintains simplicity while offering flexibility

### 3. Result Structure
**EdtResult Design**:
```kotlin
data class EdtResult(
    val success: Boolean,      // Command success indicator
    val output: String,        // Standard output content
    val error: String?,        // Error message if any
    val exitCode: Int,         // Process exit code
    val duration: Duration     // Execution time measurement
)
```

**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing platform result patterns
- Provides comprehensive execution feedback
- Enables performance monitoring and debugging

### 4. Utility Discovery Strategy
**Linux Path Structure**: `/opt/1C/1CE/components/<version>/1cedtcli`
**Rationale**:
- Follows 1C:EDT standard installation pattern
- Supports versioned installations
- Compatible with enterprise deployment scenarios

## üîß Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ (COMPLETED)
- [x] EDT_CLI utility type definition
- [x] Linux search path integration
- [x] EdtDsl class implementation
- [x] EdtContext and EdtResult classes
- [x] PlatformDsl integration

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Windows and macOS path support
- [ ] Advanced command builders for common workflows
- [ ] Workspace management helpers
- [ ] Project import/export utilities

## üé≠ User Experience Design

### Fluent API Examples
```kotlin
// Basic usage
val result = edt("1.0.0") {
    version()
}

// Command execution
val workspaceResult = edt("1.0.0") {
    run("workspace", "--list")
}

// Help information
val helpResult = edt("1.0.0") {
    help()
}
```

### Error Handling Experience
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clear error messages when EDT CLI is unavailable
- **Path Resolution**: Automatic discovery of EDT installations
- **Version Flexibility**: Support for versioned installations

## üîç Technical Considerations

### Process Execution
- **Synchronous Execution**: Uses `runBlocking` for immediate results
- **Timeout Handling**: Built-in process timeout management
- **Output Capture**: Comprehensive stdout/stderr capture
- **Resource Management**: Proper process cleanup and resource disposal

### Platform Compatibility
- **Linux**: Primary target with `/opt/1C/1CE/components` path
- **Windows**: Future support via `%PROGRAMFILES%\1C\1CE\components`
- **macOS**: Future support via `/Applications/1C/1CE/components`

### Security Considerations
- **Command Validation**: No arbitrary command execution restrictions
- **Path Sanitization**: Safe handling of file paths and arguments
- **Process Isolation**: Proper process boundary management

## üìä Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- [x] EDT CLI utility discovery and validation
- [x] Immediate command execution with result return
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- [x] Integration with existing platform DSL infrastructure

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 100ms for utility discovery
- **Command Execution**: < 5 seconds for typical commands
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead for DSL operations

### Usability Requirements
- **API Consistency**: Follows established platform patterns
- **Error Clarity**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive usage examples and API docs

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Advanced Command Builders
```kotlin
// Future workspace management
edt("1.0.0") {
    workspace {
        create("MyProject")
        import("path/to/project")
        build()
    }
}
```

### Cross-Platform Support
- Windows EDT CLI path discovery
- macOS EDT CLI path discovery
- Platform-specific installation detection

### Integration Features
- MCP server integration for remote EDT CLI access
- Configuration management for EDT workspaces
- Test automation support for EDT-based projects
